It is known for Declarative Configuration, Multi cloud support,Load balancing, Demand based Auto-scaling and self healing.
2.Core components of kubernetes Architecture?
Kubernetes is built on a set of core components that work together to provide a scalable and resilient container orchestration system. Each component plays a crucial role in managing the lifecycle of applications.
Here are those core changing components.
MASTER NODE :The master node is responsible for managing the overall state of the cluster. 
1.Api- server 
2.Controller Manger
3.Scheduler
4.ETCD
WORKER NODE:Worker nodes execute application workloads and provide compute capacity.
